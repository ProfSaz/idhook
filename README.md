# IDHook

## The Problem 
Most protocols often reward qualified participants with airdrops base on the rules that best suit them as at the time of announcing these drops, this often leads to unhappy feedbacks from communities. 
Also, some protocol actually reward their community indiscriminately without them actually contributing enough onchain value, which often results to token dumping and disengaged communities. 

## How IDHook solves this
The IDHook acts as an airdrop mechanism that rewards participants based on their active contributions to a specific liquidity pool. Instead of simply giving tokens away, the system encourages users to:
1.	**Swap Tokens**: Users who trade in the IDO pool earn proportional shares based on their trading volume.
2.	**Provide Liquidity**: Users who add liquidity to the pool are rewarded in line with their contribution and duration.

At the conclusion of the IDO, participants can claim their rewards, which are distributed fairly and transparently based on their activity in the pool.

## How It’s Different
Unlike traditional fundraising or airdrop mechanisms:
- **This is Participation-Based**: Only active participants who swap or add liquidity in the pool earn rewards. It’s not a free giveaway—it rewards effort and engagement.
- **Time-Weighted Rewards**: By considering duration and contribution size, the system encourages long-term engagement rather than, short-term behavior.

## How Token Issuers Benefit
This airdrop hook helps token issuers:
1.	Build Stronger Communities: Rewards go to those actively supporting the token's ecosystem, not passive users or opportunists.
2.	Simplify Distribution: The process is automated and transparent, reducing administrative overhead while creating trust among participants.

In Summary IDHook reimagines airdrops by combining them with incentivized participation. It turns liquidity provision and trading activity into meaningful engagement, resulting in a more sustainable token launch and a stronger community foundation.
